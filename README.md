# Music Player
My own music player made for learning Electron. 

## Features 
- Play songs and keep track of songs played. No local storage implemented yet so songs played are lost between sessions.
- Play songs in the background.
- Control everything from the tray (TODO)
- Minimal (as in I don't know what I'm doing) interface.
- Bloated as hell.
