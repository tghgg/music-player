# Music Player
My own music player made for learning Electron. 

## Features 
- Play songs and keep track of playback history.
- Control everything from the tray (with a cute Godot icon).
- Minimal (as in I don't know what I'm doing) interface.
- Probably bloated as hell.

## License
Licensed under the MIT license.
